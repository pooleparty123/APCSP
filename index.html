		<img src = "k.jpg" width= 20%>
		<p> Knives out is a really good movie that i enjoy watching, it is a murder mystery film that was directed by Rian Johnson. In this movie there is a family that is really rich and the Dad who is an old man has a care taker. The care taker would give the dad his medicine everynight, until the medicines got mixed up and he was given a deadly dosage of medicine. He then kills himself to make it look like a suicide, even though it was the caretakers fault. </p>
